## What is it

This is a Chrome plugin,
which collects soft-porn articles of 
*origo.hu* title page,
and displays them at the top of the page.

Also, there's a prototype written in Python3.

## Install

The plugin is still under development, TODOs:
- better design,
- add more items to Nasty Word List,
- hosting, packaging.

You can try it:
- open *Chrome extensions* page: `chrome://extensions`,
- turn on *developer mode* (upper right corner),
- hit *load unpacked* button, then select this project's
`extension/` directory.
